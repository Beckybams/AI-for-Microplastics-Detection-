Overview

This project applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect and classify microplastics in environmental samples. Using image-based or sensor-derived data (real or synthetic), the model identifies the presence, type, and distribution of microplastics to support environmental monitoring and research.

Problem Statement

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that pose serious risks to ecosystems and human health. Traditional detection methods are time‑consuming, expensive, and require expert analysis. This project aims to automate and accelerate microplastics detection using AI.

Objectives

Detect microplastics in environmental samples using AI models

Classify microplastics by type, size, or shape

Improve accuracy and speed compared to manual methods

Provide a scalable solution for environmental monitoring

Dataset

Type: Synthetic and/or real-world microplastics data

Features may include: particle size, shape descriptors, texture features, spectral values, or image pixels

Target: Presence/absence of microplastics or microplastics classes

Synthetic data is used to simulate realistic microplastics characteristics when real data is limited.
